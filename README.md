# Airbnb Clone

## Description

This is a clone of the Airbnb site, with exception to the payment method. The functionality to search by country and post listing by country is in place, but specific address details have been left out at this time. Using Next-Auth I was able to give the option to Sign up or Login using Google or GitHub. 

I created this with the aid of a tutorial as a way to learn  NextJS 13 and TypeScript.  I found this very insightful and utilizing the new app folder router method was very interesting and seems like it has a lot of potential for streamlining your client and server rendering. I am going to build off of this knowledge to better use NextJS and TypeScript in the future!
## Credits

This project was made possible by [Code With Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/@codewithantonio) and his tutorial [Full Stack Airbnb Clone with Next.js 13 App Router: React, Tailwind, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_-b_isI4vg&t=106s&ab_channel=CodeWithAntonio) was my springboard for this journey. Through it I was able to gain valuable knowledge of NextJS, TypeScript and a number  of other utilities.
